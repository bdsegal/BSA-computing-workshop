# Biostatistics Student Association Computing Workshop
## Statistical programming with R

These notes go over some aspects of:

1. Downloading data in R
2. Managing large desktop-sized files (a few GB in size)
3. Assessing parsing errors from `readr`
4. Manipulating data quickly with `dplyr` and `data.table` (in progress)
5. Implementing the split, apply, combine approach with `dplyr`, and reshaping and plotting with `reshape2` and `ggplot2`
6. Plotting with `ggvis`

I might also put together notes on visualizing missing data with `pheatmap` and `mi`.

You can view the html files as web pages [here](http://bdsegal.github.io/BSA-computing-workshop/).

To run tutorials 1-4, you'll either need to replicate the directory structure on your computer or change `dataPath` (at the top of each tutorial)  to wherever you downloaded the data. One way to replicate the directory structure is to clone this repository. If you clone the repository, you can run the code directly from the Rmd files.

Thanks, and happy computing!
