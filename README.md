# Biostatistics Student Association Computing Workshop
## Statistical programming with R

These notes go over some aspects of:

0. Downloading data in R
1. Managing large desktop-sized files (a few GB in size)
2. Assessing parsing errors from `readr`
3. Manipulating data quickly with `dplyr` and `data.table` (in progress)
4. Implementing the split, apply, combine approach with `dplyr`, and reshaping and plotting with `reshape2` and `ggplot2`
5. Plotting with `ggvis`

I might also put together notes on visualizing missing data with `pheatmap` and `mi`.

All html files are in the `html` folder, and the R markdown files are in the `markdown` folder.

To run tutorials 1-4, you'll either need to replicate the directory structure on your computer or change the path to the data folder. One way to replicate the directory structure is to clone this repository.

Thanks, and happy computing!
