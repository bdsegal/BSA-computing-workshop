## Statistical programming in R

These notes cover some aspects of:

1. [Downloading data in R](1.downloading_data.html)
2. [Managing large desktop-sized files (a few GB in size)](2.managing_large_files.html)
3. [Assessing parsing errors from `readr`](3.assessing_parsing_errors.html)
4. [Manipulating data quickly with `dplyr` and `data.table` (draft)](4.dplyr_data.table.html)
5. [Implementing the split, apply, combine approach with `dplyr`, and reshaping and plotting with `reshape2` and `ggplot2`](5.split_apply_combine_plot.html)
6. [Plotting with `ggvis`](6.ggvis.html)

I might also put together notes on visualizing missing data with [`pheatmap`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pheatmap/index.html) and [`mi`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mi/index.html).

To run tutorials 1-4, you'll either need to replicate the directory structure on your computer or change `dataPath` (at the top of each tutorial)  to wherever you downloaded the data. One way to replicate the directory structure is to clone the [repository](https://github.com/bdsegal/BSA-computing-workshop). If you clone the repository, you can run the code directly from the markdown files.

Thanks, and happy computing!
