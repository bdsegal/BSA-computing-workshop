## Statistical programming in R

These notes go over some aspects of:

0. [Downloading data in R](0.downloading_data.html)
1. [Managing large desktop-sized files (a few GB in size)](1.managing_large_files.html)
2. [Assessing parsing errors from `readr`](2.assessing_parsing_errors.html)
3. [Manipulating data quickly with `dplyr` and `data.table` (draft)](3.dplyr_data.table.html)
4. [Implementing the split, apply, combine approach with `dplyr`, and reshaping and plotting with `reshape2` and `ggplot2`](4.split_apply_combine_plot.html)
5. [Plotting with `ggvis`](5.ggvis.html)

I might also put together notes on visualizing missing data with `pheatmap` and `mi`.

To run tutorials 1-4, it would be easiest to clone the [repository](https://github.com/bdsegal/BSA-computing-workshop).

Feel free to contact me at bdsegal@umich.edu if you have any questions.

Thanks, and happy computing!
