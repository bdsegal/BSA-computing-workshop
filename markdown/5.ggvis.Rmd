# Introduction

`ggvis`, also by Hadley Wickham, is more recent package. It uses the same piping operators `%>%` as `dplyr`, and tends to render plots more quickly than `ggplot2`. This makes it a good complement to `Shiny`, which Mathieu will cover in a future workshop. You can also make interactive plots in `ggvis` without Shiny.

Let's remake some of the above plots from [the last tutorial] with `ggvis`, and add interactive components.

```{r, warning = TRUE, message = FALSE}
library(readr)
data <- read_csv("http://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/data/2009/csv/recs2009_public.csv",
  progress=FALSE)
```

As before, we'll ignore the parsing warnings for now (we take a closer look at them in [link to tutorial]).
